# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description
The Real Time Bus Tracker project is a web application that displays the current location of buses. It utilizes data from the v3mbta app to provide real-time updates on bus positions. One of the improvements made to this project is the inclusion of pop-ups over bus markers, which display the bus ID and occupancy status, providing users with more detailed information.

## How to Run
To run this project on your machine, follow these steps:
1. Obtain an API key from Google Maps and the v3mbta app.
2. Paste the API keys into the `map.html` file.
3. Open the `map.html` file in a web browser.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Future improvements for the Real Time Bus Tracker project could include:
- Showing the full route of the bus on the map for better route visualization.
- Implementing a search feature to allow users to find specific bus routes or stops.
